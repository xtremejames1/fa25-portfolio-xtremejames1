## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 I am a second year Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering student in the College of Engineering at Cornell University. I am interested in gaining experience in defense technology, and furthering the development of autonomous technologies in this field. Beyond my studies, I am a Marine-option Midshipman at Cornell NROTC, and the LIDAR Project Lead on the Cornell University Autoboat Student Project Team.
